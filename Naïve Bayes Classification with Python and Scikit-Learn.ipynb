    "In machine learning, Naïve Bayes classification is a straightforward and powerful algorithm for the classification task. Naïve Bayes classification is based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong independence assumption between the features.  Naïve Bayes classification produces good results when we use it for textual data analysis such as Natural Language Processing.\n",

    "Naïve Bayes models are also known as `simple Bayes` or `independent Bayes`. All these names refer to the application of Bayes’ theorem in the classifier’s decision rule. Naïve Bayes classifier applies the Bayes’ theorem in practice. This classifier brings the power of Bayes’ theorem to machine learning.\n"

    "Another tool to measure the classification model performance visually is **ROC Curve**. ROC Curve stands for **Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve**. An **ROC Curve** is a plot which shows the performance of a classification model at various \n",
    "classification threshold levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ROC Curve** plots the **True Positive Rate (TPR)** against the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** at various threshold levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**True Positive Rate (TPR)** is also called **Recall**. It is defined as the ratio of `TP to (TP + FN)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**False Positive Rate (FPR)** is defined as the ratio of `FP to (FP + TN)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ROC Curve, we will focus on the TPR (True Positive Rate) and FPR (False Positive Rate) of a single point. This will give us the general performance of the ROC curve which consists of the TPR and FPR at various threshold levels. So, an ROC Curve plots TPR vs FPR at different classification threshold levels. If we lower the threshold levels, it may result in more items being classified as positve. It will increase both True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP).\n",

    "3.\tI have compared the model accuracy score which is 0.8083 with null accuracy score which is 0.7582. So, we can conclude that our Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier model is doing a very good job in predicting the class labels.\n",
